Over the last few years, big data has started to set foot in healthcare system. Mental health of a person is a critical subject that has been discussed for years. As an engineering students, we noticed that workers in the field of IT suffer from mental health issue due to workload. Our study here focuses mainly on IT field, which wants to predict if a person is suffering from a mental health disease or not using multiple features such as age, gender, family history and so on.
This dataset was compiled by aggregating surveys conducted by Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI), a non-profit organization, over the past five years (2017-2021). Its purpose is to assess the prevalence of mental health issues among individuals employed in the technology sector and to gauge attitudes towards mental health in the workplace.
